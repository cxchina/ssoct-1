% This function will apply the filter defined by the 3D matrix filter onto
% the 3D global variable of the structure and the Doppler before they are
% normalized by the number of A-lines in each column. It will also
% filter the Number of A-lines by the filter defined by the sum along
% depths of the 3D filter. This new number of A-lines will then be used to
% normalize the 3D matrices
