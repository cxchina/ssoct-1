/* FUNCTION: alt_cksum
 * 
 * Internet checksum function for Altera
 * 
 * PARAM1: ptr          pointer to data buffer (16-bit aligned)
 * PARAM2: count        number of 16-bit elements to accumulate
 * 
 * RETURN: cksum        unsigned, 16-bit checksum value
 *
 * NOTE:  Use the connection pragma to specify the memory(s) containing the
 *        data used in the checksum.  This will only connect the Avalon
 *        master "addr" to the memory specified.  If the data can reside
 *        in multiple memories add new connection pragma statments for
 *        each memory that will potentially contain data.
